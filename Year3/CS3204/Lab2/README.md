## Lab 2: Web Services in the Cloud

### Laboratory Goals / Objectives
The goal of this lab is to introduce students to cloud computing by developing and deploying a web service in the cloud, then connect to a repository of data and process big data in the cloud.

Upon completion of this lab, the students should be aware of available cloud platforms. Students will learn about creating a cloud instance to host a web service, a database and process big data.

For this Lab assignment I have created:

- Amazon Elastic Beanstalk (EBS) related folder with a .gitignore file
- 4 web files (php based)
    - landing page
    - viewing the database
    - adding data point
    - removing data point
