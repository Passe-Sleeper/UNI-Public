## Lab 2: Web Services in the Cloud

### Final Submission
This filing system/pdf is what I was meant to submit for my assignment. Despite being graded on the **Draft** version, I will still take this opportunity to share what I have made with the world (and my lecturer if he accidentally clicks here!).

There is a _GoldReserve_ folder present in this directory, that is __AWS EBS Instance__ (git repository) created for my Lab Assignment.

Once again, I apologies for any inconvenience as a result of my mistake.
