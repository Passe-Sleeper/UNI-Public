## Lab 1: Virtual machines and containers

### Laboratory Goals / Objectives
Students will investigate the virtual machine and container technologies used in clouds, by creating virtual machines and containers on their own laptops. Timing the execution of an application on the laptop/desktop and then by running it in the virtual machine and then in the container environments will give an indication of the differences in performance between VMs, containers and the host computer.

For this Lab assignment I have created:

- 1 app file (python based)
- 1 DockerFile (my container based software)
- 3 CSV files (which contain my results)
